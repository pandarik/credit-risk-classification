# credit-risk-classification
Objective: This project aims to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/pandarik/credit-risk-classification. Install Required Dependencies: Make sure to install all necessary Python libraries before starting the analysis. This project mainly uses pandas, scikit-learn. Data file is in the Resources folder.

## Usage
Open the credit_risk_classification.ipynb notebook and run each cell sequentially. The notebook is designed to guide you through the data loading, splitting, modeling, reviewing results, and model performance.
